# Bukavu

Bukavu is a set of tools for building resilient, interactive, offline-first, isomorphic web applications
using [GWT](https://www.gwtproject.org), functional reactive programming, and a virtual DOM.

This library is an open-source version of [ActivityInfo 4.0](https://www.activityinfo.org) internals. The
process of extracting these tools from the ActivityInfo code base is a work in progress.
